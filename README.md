# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Python number guessing game.

The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 10, and the user has to guess it.  
After each guess, the program tells the user whether the guess is too high or too low, until the correct number is guessed or the user quits.

## How it works
- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 10
- The user enters a guess
- The program compares the guess to the secret number
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed or the user types `quit`
